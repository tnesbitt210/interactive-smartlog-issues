## 💭 About This Repo
This repo is just for issue tracking — the extension itself is not open source (at least for now).
I’ve held off on open-sourcing to give the project time to mature and avoid early-stage clones. That said, I'm actively improving it based on feedback, and open-sourcing may still happen in the future.
